# Redwood Supabase Auth

This repo represents a "completed" full tutorial (both parts 1 and part 2) BUT we have substituted [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) Auth for Netlify Auth.

You can read more about [Supabase Auth in the docs](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication#supabase).

To get the most out of this demo you should probably complete the full tutorial yourself first and then come back here.

This comes with one significant compromise, it is not easy (at least right now) to setup roles for a Supabase Auth integration so once logged in users effectively have all roles, moderator and admin.
## Setup

1. Clone and install this repo
1. Create a new Supabase account and database
1. Replace the environment variables for SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, and SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
